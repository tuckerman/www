    <p>
      I am an engineer interested in the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Large-Scale Distributed Systems.
      Currently, I manage a team focused on data search and understanding at <a href="https://wayve.ai">Wayve</a>.
      I was previously the tech lead for foundation model development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have worked at Alphabet (Google, Google X, Everyday Robots), Airbnb, Sherwin-Williams, and I am an alumnus of South Park Commons where I founded General Reliability.
      I am also an angel investor and previously have advised/consulted for a number of SaaS/infrastructure startups.
      You can learn more by checking out my <a href="./resume.html">resume</a>.
      I make a selection of my talks available <a href="./artifacts/">here</a>.
