    <p>Hi, my name is Cameron. I'm a frequent dabbler, dad, coffee drinker, software engineer. I have experience in designing, building, and operating large-scale, complex systems across storage infrastructure, AI/Robotics, and product teams in management, SWE, and SRE roles.</p>

    <p>I'm currently exploring the future of version control and collaboration for software teams struggling to scale git workflows or heavily investing in AI tools. If you are interested in learning more, say <span class="email">hi@renorm.dev</span>!</p>

    <p>I have previously worked at Wayve, Google/Google X, Airbnb, and I am an alumnus of South Park Commons. I am also an angel investor (notable investments are Figma and KUDO) and am an advisor at some AI/infrastructure startups.</p>

    <p>You can learn more by checking out my <a href="/resume">resume</a>. I make a selection of my talks available <a href="/talks">here</a>.</p>

    <p>You can reach me at <span class="email">cameron@ctuck.com</span> or via Twitter DMs <span class="email">@tuckerman</span>. If you wish to schedule a meeting, you can do so via <a href="https://calendar.app.google/7QuX9qr4iY6YWZbe6" rel="noopener">Google Calendar</a>.</p>
