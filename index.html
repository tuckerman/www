    <p>
      I am an engineer interested in the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Large-Scale Distributed Systems.
      Currently, I am a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://wayve.ai">Wayve</a> where I am the tech lead for foundation model development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously I have worked at Alphabet (Google, Google X, Everyday Robots), Airbnb, and I am an alumnus of South Park Commons.
      I also am an amateur angel investor and previously have advised/consulted for a number of SaaS/infrastructure startups.
