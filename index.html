    <p>
      I am an engineering leader with extensive experience in designing,
      building, and operating large-scale, complex systems across
      infrastructure, AI/Robotics, and product teams across both SWE and SRE roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I manage a team focused on data search and understanding at
      Wayve. Previously, I served as the tech lead for foundation model
      development on our science team.

      I have previously worked at Alphabet (Google, Google X),
      Airbnb, and I am an alumnus of South Park Commons where
      I founded General Reliability. I am also an angel investor and previously
      have advised/consulted for a number of SaaS/infrastructure startups.
